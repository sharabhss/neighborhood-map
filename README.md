# Neighborhood Map

## Summary

Neighborhood Map is project that's part of the Udacity FEND where using knockoutjs, Google Maps API, New York Times API, and other resources, you build a map with set locations and provide information about the location. There is a filtered search bar involved to find the location you're looking for and map that provides the information about each location.

### Set up and Run

* Download zip or clone github repository
* Inside "neighborhood-map" folder, there is an "index.html" file, which is the main file to run the application
* The folder also includes this README file as well as the CSS and JS files used to make the app. Nothing else needs to changed to run the current version of the app.
* If you want to make your own changes, only then would you want to get through other files. "main.js" is the file that includes all the funtionality for running the app.
